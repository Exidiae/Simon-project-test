So , using jQuery Make a replica of the game SIMON 

The game will firstly prompt the user to click the start button to the play the game 

when the user clicks start, it will show level 1 and show a pattern
    after showing the pattern the title will change to "level X - (Your turn!)"

after completing a level , it will add a point depending on how many squares were clicked 
    so by completing level 2 , it will have a point system of 3 , going up by increments of "!"

so by the time the loser fails, their highscore is displayed and option to retry/play again appears

So , using jQuery Make a replica of the game SIMON 

The game will firstly prompt the user to click the start button to the play the game 

when the user clicks start, it will show level 1 and show a pattern
    after showing the pattern the title will change to "level X - (Your turn!)"

after completing a level , it will add a point depending on how many squares were clicked 
    so by completing level 2 , it will have a point system of 3 , going up by increments of "!"

so by the time the loser fails, their highscore is displayed and option to retry/play again appears

---------------------------------------

so far i have up to the face that it flashes and detects what flashed 
so what now do i have to do?

- make it repeat infintely until losing (using a while loop most likely)
- make it generate a new number everytime in the while loop so it has something extra to go on
- make it record the score and level to inrease perhaps using append


* so as the game goes on it needs to add 1 more per try the user does. *

so a while loop that increments the LEVELS and the SCORES BY 1 IS NEEDED

ok the issue is , the SIMON game must 

flash a light --> increase lvl by 1 and score by user clicks ----> then it will add the first flashed light into a sequence --->
so the sequence increases per flashed light 

so 1 light , then add to sequence 
 2 lights with a new one, then that gets added

 only one flashing is the new one

the user clicks get added and it progresses on
